# Command-8-Remapper
Use DigiDesign Command 8 (Not in standalone mode) with any midi compliant DAW

The DigiDesign Command|8 is a old beast but still a perfectly respectable control surface the problem arives that it's pretty much locked to ProTools.
I just can't use ProTools i find the UI super confusing is i wrote this. 

What does it do?

Well, it simulates the Command|8 being used in ProTools giving you full funcationality, Yes the Command|8 has "stand alone" mode but you also lose a lot of buttons and functionality.
