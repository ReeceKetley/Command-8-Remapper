# Command8 Remapper (ReCommand8) - Use DigiDesign on any Ableton (Windows)

A reverse engineering effort to repurpose otherwise obsolete audio equipment and prevent ewaste. 

Use DigiDesign Command 8 (Not in standalone mode) with any midi compliant DAW

Use every feature on the Command8 rather than just the mixer section in Stand-Alone mode.

How does it work? 
ReCommand8 restranslates the input from the command8 into MackieControl messages (which works in pretty much every DAW i tried)

Whats working?
All buttons including motorized faders 

Requirements: 
teVirtualMidi Driver
