# Command8 Remapper (ReCommand8)
Use DigiDesign Command 8 (Not in standalone mode) with any midi compliant DAW

Use every feature on the Command8 rather than just the mixer section in Stand-Alone mode.

How does it work? 
ReCommand8 restranslates the input from the command8 into MackieControl messages (which works in pretty much every DAW i tried)

Whats working?
All buttons including motorized faders 

Why?
I got a Command|8 at a good price. I figured others might want to use this software too.

You will need to compile this if you don't know how i suggest you wait untill i've finished the project and posted the binaries.
